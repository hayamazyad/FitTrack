## Project Overview
This repository contains the **frontend** of our Fitness Tracker web application.  
It allows users to explore exercises, track their workouts, and monitor progress through a clean and responsive interface.

You can preview our application in action here:

## Live Demo
**Link to the deployed application:** _coming soon_

## Data Entities
The application currently simulates a backend using mock data for the following entities:
- Users  
- Exercises  
- Workouts  
- Progress Logs  

A `mockData.js` file is included in the `/data` folder. It contains arrays representing the entities listed above, which are imported by the pages to mimic user interaction and data persistence since no backend is connected yet.

## Local Setup Instructions

To run the frontend locally:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-folder
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Copy the local server link that appears in your terminal and paste it into your preferred browser.
